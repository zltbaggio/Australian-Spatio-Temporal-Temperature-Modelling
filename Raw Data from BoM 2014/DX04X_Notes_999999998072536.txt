ELEMENTS CHOSEN
_______________

Highest monthly temperature in degrees C
Lowest monthly temperature in degrees C
Mean daily maximum temperature in degrees C
Mean daily minimum temperature in degrees C

For primary information on elements see http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/cdo/about/definitionsother.shtml#cloudydays




DATA USED
_________

Data is displayed only for those months where there were at least 21 days on which observations
were taken.  For data observed several times a day, only those days where there were at least
6 observations are included.  Only quality controlled data has been used.




GAPS AND MISSING DATA
_____________________

Very few sites have a complete unbroken record of climate information. A site
may have been closed, reopened, upgraded to a full weather site or downgraded
to a rainfall only site during its existence causing breaks in the record for
some or all elements. Some gaps may be for one element due to a damaged
instrument, others may be for all elements due to the absence or illness of
an observer.




INSTUMENTS AND OBSERVATIONAL PRACTICES
______________________________________

Historically a nearby site (within about 1 mile in earlier days) may have used the same 
site number.  There may have been changes in instrumentation and/or observing practices
over the period included in a dataset, which may have an effect on the long-term record.
In recent years many sites have had observers replaced by Automatic Weather Stations,
either completely or at certain times of the day.  




TIME
____

For a part of the year some Australian States adopt Daylight Saving Time (DST), and
observers continue to take observations according to the local clock.  Times provided 
with this data are Local Time, unless otherwise noted. 

Care needs to be taken when comparing values from year to year or month to month, because for
some elements the effect of one hour can be marked, for example air temperature often rises 
sharply between 8am and 9am.

Daylight Saving has been used in many Australian states since 1973. The
changeovers occur almost always in October and March, but exact dates vary
from State to State and year to year. More information can be found at:
http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/daysavtm.shtml




ROUNDING
________

The primary way of sending current weather information around the world is via a coded message 
known as a SYNOP.  This message only allows some measurements to be sent as rounded values.  
Once manuscript records have been sent in many of these values are typed in with greater 
precision (normally to one decimal place). This usually occurs within a few months.

If consecutive values all have a zero in the decimal place, then it is almost certain that
rounding was used earlier.  A new type of message format is progressively being introduced to
overcome this situation.




COPYRIGHT
_________

The copyright for any data is held in the Commonwealth of Australia and the purchaser
shall give acknowledgement of the source in reference to the data.  Apart from dealings
under the copyright Act, 1968, the purchaser shall not reproduce, modify or supply (by
sale or otherwise) these data without written permission.  Enquiries should be made in
the first instance to the National Climate Centre, Bureau of Meteorology, 
PO Box 1289K, Melbourne 3001, marked to the attention of SRDS.




LIABILITY
_________

While every effort is made to supply the best data available this may not be possible
in all cases.  We do not give any warranty, nor accept any liability in relation
to the information given, except that liability (if any), that is required by law.





IF DATA IS NOT AS REQUESTED
___________________________

If the data provided are not as requested, the data will be repeated at no extra cost, 
provided that:
a) the Bureau is notified within 60 days.
b) the printout/disc/data file is returned to the Bureau for checking.
c) there has been a fault or error in providing the data.

Where there has been no fault or error of provision, the cost involved in
requested corrective action such as resending the data or providing alternative
sites will be charged for as necessary.

SITE DETAILS FILE

This file contains the details for the current site or are those which applied when the site
was closed.  Many sites have been moved, downgraded, upgraded etc over the years.

LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES
________________________

Latitudes and longitudes are given to 4 decimal places, but in many cases will not be
accurate to 4 decimal places.  This is because in the early days the positions of stations
were estimated from maps. Gradually the network of open stations is being checked (and
if necessary corrected) using GPS (Global Positioning System). The method used is given
in the site details file.




WMO INDEX NUMBER
________________

This is the number assigned to a site that makes international weather reports every day.
The number is not actively used in the climate archive, and only a few hundred such 
numbers are assigned at any time.  These are not perpetual but may be reassigned 
where a site no longer makes the international reports (synops); thus a particular
number cannot be regarded as unique and exclusive to any particular site.
